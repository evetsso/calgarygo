Vincent will not be able to attend the meeting on December 29, 2024.
He normally brings the equipment for us to all play with, so that day
all players are encouraged to bring their own gear.  As long as at
least half of us bring a set, we'll be good to play.

Now might be a good time to show off your fancy Go board you've got
at home!
