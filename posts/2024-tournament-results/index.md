I want to thank everyone who participated in the tournament this year. Thanks to you we had a record turnout of 28 players this year ranging in strength from 20 kyu to 6 dan.

This year's winners were Yimeng Lui 8k in the D division, Clayton Tiro-Burns 2k in the C division, Jim Zhou 2d in the B division and Martin Mueller 6d in the A division. 

A big shout out as always to Brentwood Co-Op for allowing us to use their space free of charge.

Here's hoping next year's tournament is even better!
