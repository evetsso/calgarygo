We had a fantastic turnout this year, with 12 players in the Dan Division and 8 players in the Kyu Division. John Hill took first place in the Kyu Division, winning all 6 of his games, while Kai Lin, Luke Suo and Robert Hu tied for first place 
in the Dan Division with 5 wins apiece.

I wish to once again thank Brentwood Co-Op for allowing us to use their community room and to everyone who registered and participated in the tournament; without you there is no tournament.

I took many lessons on board this year and will be applying them to make our 2024 tournament even more successful. I hope to see you all there!
