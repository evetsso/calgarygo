David Mu took first place with an impressive 5 out of 6 games won.

Deryk Ducharme took second place with 3 wins, handing David his one and only loss during the tournament.

I'd like to give a special thanks to Deryk for coming all the way out from Manitoba to be with us and to Brentwood Co-op for allowing us to use their community room.

I look forward to seeing you all again next year!
