Our hosts, the Calgary Jiang Zhe Shanghai Association, will be using our space for Chinese New Year 
celebrations during our regular meeting times on February 3 and 10. Go club meetings are cancelled for those 
dates.

However, the space is available on both Saturdays @ 6:30. A bunch of us will be getting together on the 2nd and 
9th in lieu of regular meetups on the 3rd and 10th.

Happy year of the pig!
