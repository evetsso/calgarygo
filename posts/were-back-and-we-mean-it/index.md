Okay, let's try this one more time.

The Calgary Public Library is once again open for regular activities, so it's time for the Calgary Go Club to resume meetings!

The first meeting back shall be March 6th, 2022.  Regular meeting time is in effect, 12-5pm at the tables near the "fishbowl" on the third floor.  There's a large mural of a fish there.

See you soon!
