[There's been a fire at the Central Library.](https://www.ctvnews.ca/calgary/article/contained-fire-closes-central-library-in-downtown-calgary/)

However, the fire has been contained and the [Calgary Library website](https://www.calgarylibrary.ca/) reports that the Central Library will reopen as usual on Sunday.  So the September 14 meeting is unaffected.
