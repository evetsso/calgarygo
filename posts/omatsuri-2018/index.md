Details:

* Who
    * Anyone who wants to play or learn Go!
* When
    * Saturday, August 11, 2018, 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM
* Where

This is a great opportunity to introduce the game to beginners, and have a lot of fun in the process.

Vincent and Steve will be running the table as the official volunteers, but any other players are welcome to come by to play, chat, or teach.  The rest of the festival is always a lot of fun too, so we hope to see you there!
