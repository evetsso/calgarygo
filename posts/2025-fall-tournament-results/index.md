Thank you to everyone who came out to participate in our first Fall Tournament. With a great turnout of 20 players there is clearly a demand so our intention is to make this an annual event just like our Spring Tournament.

The winners were Axyl Schulz in the C division, Micheal Hsu in the B division and Robert Hu in the A division.

Our usual shout out to Brentwood Co-Op for allowing us to use their community room free of charge.

Stay tuned for our Spring Tournament coming in May!
