Calling all volunteers in the area of Panorama Hills!

The Panorama Hills Residents Association is interested in having some Go teaching sessions over the summer, mainly aimed at seniors in that community.  The intent is to have some recurring sessions of teaching and games, and perhaps an informal 
tournament at the end of the season.

Exact location, times and dates are still to be determined, and will depend on the availability of volunteers to run the classes.  Please send an email to me (evetsso at gmail.com) if you're interested!  We can work out how to distribute 
equipment to you.
