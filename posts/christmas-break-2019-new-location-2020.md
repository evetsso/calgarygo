There will be no Go club meetings on December 22 and 29, 2019, as
we'll break for Christmas holiday.

In the new year, we will have to make some changes.  The Calgary
Jiang Zhe Shanghai Association will no longer be hosting us in 2020,
so we will need to change time and location for meetups.

We are in the process of moving our operations to the new Central
Library.  More details will come, but you can expect to find us there
on Sunday afternoons.

See you in 2020!
