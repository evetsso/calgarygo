This tournament will use [Chinese rules](https://senseis.xmp.net/?ChineseRules).
Time controls, divisions and format will be based on registrations but the goal is to have 5-7 rounds and for everyone to play in every round. Priority will also be given to pairing local players with those from outside Calgary. If necessary a handicap will be instituted in the lowest division to ensure challenging games for all.
We aim to start late on Saturday and finish early on Sunday to facilitate players coming from out of town. An exact schedule will be announced once we have an idea who will be attending.
Snacks/drinks will be available but lunch will not be provided. Players are free to bring their own lunch or buy from nearby shops/restaurants.
Free street parking is available within walking distance.

Players requiring a billet should email Vincent van der Ploeg at <a href="mailto:studentofsmith@gmail.com">studentofsmith@gmail.com</a> and I will try to match you with local players willing to host.

Hope to see you there!
