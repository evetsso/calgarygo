There will be no Go club meetings on December 22 and 29, 2019, as
we'll break for Christmas holiday.

In the new year, we will have to make some changes.  The Calgary
Jiang Zhe Shanghai Association will no longer be hosting us in 2020,
so we will need to change time and location for meetups.

We will be moving our meetings to Sundays 12-5 PM, on the second
floor of the Calgary Central Library.

We aim to meet at the giant size chess board on the third floor.
There are some tables that we can sit at.  If those tables are
occupied, we will find other tables on the third floor.

See you in 2020!
