Well, it's been a long time but we are now cleared to resume regular Go Club meetings!

Meetings shall resume at the Calgary Central Library, 12-5pm Sundays.  The first day back is August 29th, 2021.

All attendees are encouraged to get their COVID vaccines, to protect themselves and everyone else.  The pandemic hasn't gone away, but the more of us that are vaccinated, the safer we'll all be.

And of course, not everyone will be comfortable having social gatherings at this point in time.  Only consider attending if you feel comfortable with it!
