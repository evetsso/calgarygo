Go club meetings shall be suspended until further notice, starting with our 
upcoming meeting on March 15.

Please watch this space for updates, as the coronavirus situation is always 
changing.

But it is important to curb the spread of the disease to protect the whole 
community.  As much as we love to play, safety must come first.  So 
everyone, please take care of yourselves, and we will resume normal play 
when it is appropriate to do so.
