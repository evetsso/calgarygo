Thanks to everyone who came out to make this year's Spring Tournament a rousing success! With a solid turnout of 26 players we had some fierce competition, particularly in the "B" division.

This year's winners were Xavier Dunn in the D division, Jim Zhou in the C division, Clayten Skibinsky in the B division and Xiaofei Deng in the A division.

I would again like to thank Brentwood Co-Op for allowing us to use their community room free of charge.

I look forward to seeing everyone at the next tournament!
