Thanks to you we had a record turnout of 28 players this year ranging in strength from 20 kyu to 6 dan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's winners were Yimeng Lui 8k in the D division, Clayton Tiro-Burns 2k in the C division, Jim Zhou 2d in the B division and Martin Mueller 6d in the A division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big shout out as always to Brentwood Co-Op for allowing us to use their space free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's hoping next year's tournament is even better!&lt;/p&gt;

John Hill took first place in the Kyu Division, winning all 6 of his games, while Kai Lin, Luke Suo and Robert Hu tied for first place 
in the Dan Division with 5 wins apiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish to once again thank Brentwood Co-Op for allowing us to use their community room and to everyone who registered and participated in the tournament; without you there is no tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took many lessons on board this year and will be applying them to make our 2024 tournament even more successful. I hope to see you all there!&lt;/p&gt;
