# About

The Calgary Go Club plays the ancient game of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29), also known as Weiqi or Baduk.

We provide an opportunity for players of all ages and all skill
levels to enjoy the game, learn from one another, and have fun!

# Meetings
The club meets every Sunday from 12-5pm, at the Calgary Central
Library, at 800 3 Street SE, directly east of City Hall.

We meet at the tables by the "fishbowl" on the 3rd floor, near the large mural of a fish on the south wall.
If those tables are not available, we will find other tables on the
3rd floor to play on.

Because we meet in a public space, we do not need to charge a
membership fee.  We will bring a few sets of boards and stones, but
feel free to bring your own if you wish.
