# About

The Calgary Go Club plays the ancient game of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29), also known as Weiqi or Baduk.

We provide an opportunity for players of all ages to enjoy the game, learn from one another, and have fun!

# Meetings
The club meets every Sunday at 6:30pm, at the Calgary Jiang Zhe Shanghai Association.  The address is #114, 3 Avenue SE, in Calgary's Chinatown.
